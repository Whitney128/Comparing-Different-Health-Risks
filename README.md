Finding the correlations between poverty and states that lack healthcare using a scatterplot. 
Once these correlations have been done, added correlations comparing smokers, obseity, age, household income to the scatterplot as well.
This project is to see what trends are shaping peoples lives. See health risks facing particular demographics from 2014 data from the Us Census Bureau.

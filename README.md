Comparing Different Health Risks

This project is to see what trends are shaping peoples lives. See health risks facing particular demographics from 2014 data from the Us Census Bureau.
Analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings.

Technology:

•	JavaScript

•	HTML

•	D3.js

Directions:

create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.


Include state abbreviations in the circles.


Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Finding the correlations between poverty and states that lack healthcare using a scatterplot. 
Once these correlations have been done, added correlations comparing smokers, obseity, age, household income to the scatterplot as well.
This scatterplot is now interactive you can click on any label on ither one of the axis's to compare against different health risks.
Looking at the scatter plot you can see the correlations between states that lack healthcare and poverty rate in each state.
